Speech Emotion Recognition 🎙️😃😢😡

  📌 Overview

This project focuses on **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The aim is to classify emotions from audio signals and help machines understand human feelings through voice.

Emotions considered in this project include:

* Neutral 🙂
* Happy 😃
* Sad 😢
* Angry 😡
* Fear 😨
* Disgust 🤢
* Surprise 😲

The model processes audio data, extracts relevant features (like MFCC, chroma, mel spectrograms), and trains classifiers to recognize emotions accurately.

 🚀 Features

* Preprocessing of audio files (noise removal, trimming, feature extraction)
* Extraction of MFCC, Chroma, Mel-Spectrogram, Contrast, and Tonnetz features
* Model training using ML/DL algorithms
* Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Visualization of training results and confusion matrix

---

 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Languages: Python 🐍
* Libraries:

  * `librosa` (audio processing)
  * `numpy`, `pandas` (data handling)
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (visualization)
  * `scikit-learn` (ML models)
  * `keras` / `tensorflow` (deep learning)

## 📊 Dataset

The project can work with standard SER datasets such as:

* **RAVDESS** (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
* **TESS** (Toronto Emotional Speech Set)
* **CREMA-D** (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset)

Datasets need to be placed in the `data/` directory.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone 
cd speech-emotion-recognition

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
env\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

### Training the Model

```bash
python main.py --mode train
```

### Testing/Prediction

```bash
python main.py --mode test --input data/sample.wav
```

---

## 📈 Results

* Achieved accuracy of **XX%** on RAVDESS dataset
* Visualization of confusion matrix shows good recognition across most classes

(Replace `XX%` with actual results after training)

---

## 🔮 Future Work

* Improve performance using **transformer-based architectures**
* Real-time emotion recognition system
* Deployment as a **web/mobile app** with Flask/Streamlit
